# <RIDDLIN>

## Description

- An application built with UN sustainability goals as a starting point with the aim to provide a fun and engaging way for tourists and students to explore Las Palmas de Gran Canaria
- The project was built as a part of an Erasmus program bringing web development students from Denmark, Iceland and Spain to work together in Las Palmas. The group was formed from students with design, front-end and back-end competencies
- Riddlin provides a one-stop-place for short and interesting information about historical and cultural monuments with the base of gamification
- Throughout the group work a lot of challenges had to be overcome related to communication, organisation, work style and technical competences which led to a definite growth in the students' personal work style as a member of a team
